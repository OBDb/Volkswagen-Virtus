    description: "The Volkswagen Virtus is a subcompact sedan (B-segment) manufactured by Volkswagen since 2018. It was first introduced in Brazil in November 2017, with sales starting in January 2018. The Virtus is based on the Polo Mk6 with an extended wheelbase and uses the Volkswagen Group MQB A0 platform. It is marketed as a sedan counterpart to the Polo, slotting between the smaller Voyage and larger Jetta in VW Brazil's sedan line-up. The front fascia shares styling cues with the Polo, including modifications made for the South American market such as a redesigned bumper. The wheelbase is 2,651 mm, 85 mm longer than the Polo. The trunk has a capacity of 521 liters, 200 liters more than the Polo. In Brazil, all Virtus versions are sold as flex-fuel vehicles (petrol and ethanol). Engine options include a 1.6-liter MSI four-cylinder, and TSI engines with 1.0-liter and 1.4-liter variants. The Virtus was also sold in Argentina (from February 2018) and Mexico (from August 2019). The pre-facelift model received a Latin NCAP 2.0 five-star rating for both adult and child protection in 2017."

The Indian version uses the MQB A0 IN platform with up to 95% localized parts.

The range-topping GT model includes cosmetic upgrades such as dual-tone roof, sunroof, red accents, red brake calipers, and aluminum pedals.
