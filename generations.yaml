    description: "The Volkswagen Virtus is a subcompact sedan primarily designed for emerging markets, including South America, India, and parts of Asia. Introduced in 2018, it's essentially the sedan version of the sixth-generation Polo, built on Volkswagen's MQB A0 platform. The exterior features a clean, sophisticated design with a flowing roofline that transitions smoothly into a short deck lid, giving it more attractive proportions than many sedan derivatives of hatchbacks. The front end shares styling cues with the Polo, while the rear features distinctive wraparound taillights. Engine options vary by market but typically include 1.0-liter three-cylinder engines in naturally aspirated and turbocharged forms, plus a 1.6-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder in some regions, with power outputs ranging from approximately 85 to 115 horsepower. Transmission options generally include 5 or 6-speed manuals and 6-speed automatics or 6-speed DSG dual-clutch units. The interior is largely shared with the Polo, featuring a modern dashboard design centered around a touchscreen infotainment system, with digital instrumentation available on higher trims. A significant selling point is the spacious cabin and class-leading trunk space, making it practical as a family vehicle despite its compact exterior dimensions. In 2022, an updated version was introduced in some markets with refreshed styling and enhanced technology features. The Virtus has been particularly successful in Brazil and India, where it competes in the premium subcompact sedan segment."
